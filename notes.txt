- We need to keep UI in sync with our state. We use useState variable
- Why react is fast? fast DOM manupulation. WHy fast DOM manupulation ? bcz of Diff algoritm


- Representation of real dom is Virtual DOM

# DESTRUCTURING THE OBJECT INSTEAD OF props

const ComponentProps = (props) => {
    return (
        <>
            <p>{props.attr}</p>
        </>
    )
} 
<ComponentProps attr="xyz" >
------------------------------------
We can destructure the object and write instead of props.
const ComponentProps = ({attr}) => { // destructuring the object
    return (
        <>
            // <p>{props.attr}</p> // no need to write props now
            <p>{attr}</p> 
        </>
    )
} 
<ComponentProps attr="xyz" >


- instead of writing each prop individually , we can do something like This
name={restaurant[1].data.name} // this is normal way
{...restaurant[1].data} // using spread operator

- Why we need Virtual DOM?
Virtual DOM is a Representation of actual DOM, we need Virtual DOM for reconciliation.
Reconciliation uses Diff algorithm, and diff algorithm finds out the difference between trees,  and will only re-render the specific portion of uor app which is found by diff algorithm.

# React FIBER ? learn about it
React changed the reconciliation method. React fibre is new reconcialiation engine and came in react 16. It is responsible for diff

# We never have to use INDEX as a key.
