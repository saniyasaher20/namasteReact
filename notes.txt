# ROUTER
- npm i react-router-dom
- import {createBrowserRouter} from "react-router-dom"   // in App.js
1- createBrowserRouter is a component provided by react-router-dom. It is used for creating the router. It will decide what will happen on path:"/xyz". It takes a array, and array takes the paths in object form. 
    createBrowserRouter(  [   {}, {}, ...  ]  )
- always create it after Applayout. It won't work if create it before component.

    //Creating a router. 
    const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
        {
            path: "/",
            element: <AppLayout /> // AppLayout will loaded on "/"
        },
        {
            path: "/about",
            element: <About />
        }
    ]);

2- We created the appRouter, second step to provide this router to our app

- import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom"   // in App.js

- RouterProvider is a component provided by react-router-dom. It is used to tell our app about the router.
    
    root.render( <RouterProvider router={appRouter} /> )


- problem with anchor tag is that it refreshes the whole page, so instead of giving anchor tag to links, use the following: 
    import {Link} from "react-router-dom"

    <Link to="/about"> About </Link> 

- TWO TYPES OF ROUTING
    1. CLient side routing : 
    2. Server side routing : All our pages comes from server
