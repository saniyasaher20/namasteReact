# CHAPTER 5
### Q1. What is the difference between Named Export, Default export, and * as Export?
1) **Default Export:** 
    - In default export we write like this on the last line of component file ðŸ‘‡
    
            export default Header

    - Use it when you have only one component in a file
    - Default Import: We can change the name of import as well

            import Header from ./components/Header
        
        or

            import NewHeader from ./components/Header
    - Usage: `<Header />` or `<NewHeader />`
2)  **Named Export:**
    - When we write like this ðŸ‘‡. This is called named export  

            export const Header = () => {...}

    - Recommended method when we have more than one component in a file. 
    - Named Import: 

            import { Header } from ./componentsHeader
    - Usage: `<Header />`
3) **\* as Export:**
    - If there are more than component in a single file and we have done named export there then we can import them like this ðŸ‘‡.  _obj_ is any object name

            import * as obj from ./components/Header
    - Usage: `<obj.Header>, <obj.Title>`

### Q2. What is the impirtance of config.js file?
- It is good practice to create a config.js/constant.js file in src folder.
- When we need same thing in many places, we can create a constant for that value and can use it anywhere. So we need to change it, we can change it from one place only. Example ðŸ‘‡
- constant.js -> export const IMAGE_CDN_URL = "xyz.com/img.jpg"
- Other files -> import { IMAGE_CDN_URL } from "./constants"

### Q3. What are React Hooks?
- React Hooks are just normal function of javascript, already created by fb devs to perform a specific functionality. eg. useState() is a hook

        import { useState } from react;
---
### Q4. Why do we need useState Hook?
- To create a state variable
- It returns a array `[variableName, function to update the variable]`
- e.g.

        [myVariable, setMyVariable] = useState()
